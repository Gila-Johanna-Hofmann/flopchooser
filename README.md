# Flopchooser

Flopchooser lets you guess which of two movies was the bigger flop - the comparison is based on IMDB-ratings.<br/>Flopchooser is my first ever Angular-App. It's the solution to the coding-challenge in chapter two, "Organizing an Angular Application", of ["Fundamentals of Angular"-tutorial by Joe Eames](https://thinkster.io/tutorials/fundamentals-of-angular-getting-started).
